<p>In version 15, <em>Image Builder</em> gained support for creating
<a href="https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">OSTree</a> commits.
You can install a Linux system using those OSTree commits by using
the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda">Anaconda Installer</a>
and its
<a href="https://anaconda-installer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kickstart.html">Kickstart functionality</a>.
This process is rather involved, with none of the individual parts
providing a complete solution yet, so let me walk you through it.</p>
